# ReliefExchange-ICS4U
Relief Exchange is a platform where **Generosity meets Community**. This website built by students at John Fraser Secondary School is meant for newcomers, immigrants, or any hard working individuals to find the essentials they need. In a society where individuals are struggling to be able to simply get the everyday items they need, and where waste is abundant, we built a platform where users can donate and trade for absolutely free! On the Relief Exchange platform, users sign up to create an account that allows them to either post an item they donâ€™t need anymore, or browse through almost any category to find something for them. With how easy it is to simply throw something away, traditional donation centres are receving less and less items each year. By having an easy to use, online platform, we hope promote accessinlity so users are more motivated to donate their items, instead of aiding to our ecological impact.
