# A Guide to Navigating Github

1. **Navbar Options**: Below the repository title, you'll find options to access the repository code, view issues, and pull requests.

2. **Code Tab**: Here, you can browse the project's files and folders. Inside a file of code, you will see a radio button labelled "Blame" on the top left of the file. The 'Blame' function allows you to see who contributed to which parts of the file.
    - **Branches**: A dropdown on the left side of the Code tab shows you the branches of the repository. Each branch represents a different version of the project.
    - **Commits**: Listed under the green "Code" button is an option labelled "commits" are the commits - saved changes to the code. Clicking on them reveals the details of these changes.

3. **Issues Tab**: This section holds tasks for contributors and tracks reported bugs or feature requests. Discussions about each issue can be found and joined here.

4. **Pull Requests Tab**: This is where you review proposed changes to the code. Open and closed pull requests can be viewed and discussed. Merging of pull requests is also done here if you have write access to the repository.

5. **Actions Tab**: Actions is where the history of all tasks in the repository is kept. It's often used for testing or deploying code.

6. **Projects Tab**: In Projects, you can create and view project boards for task management, planning future work, or tracking ongoing work.

7. **Wiki Tab**: The Wiki is for hosting project documentation. It is a resource for detailed information about the project and how to contribute to it.

8. **Security Tab**: Here, you can find an overview of the project's security policies and report security vulnerabilities.

9. **Insights Tab**: Insights provide statistics and analytical data about the project. You can find a graph of commit activity, a list of contributors, and a dependency graph here.
